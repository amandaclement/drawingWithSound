Drawing With Sound is a data visualization that illustrates patterns by capturing
the invisible properties of sound. Users can use their voice, instruments, natural
noises, or any other audio as input to output a visual representation on their
deviceâ€™s screen. The design is constructed based on changes in the detected
characteristics (volume and frequency) of the registered sound.

The project includes two sections: CREATE and BROWSE. CREATE is where users can
create a visualization using their own audio. It includes a few controls allowing
the user to customize their pattern. Once their design is complete, they may save
it to their personal device, delete it, or upload it to the gallery. When a user
chooses to upload their pattern to the gallery, they are presented with an HTML
form asking them to fill out some basic details about themselves and their design.
On submit, the HTML form data is stored in a database to be retrieved and displayed
on the BROWSE page. At this stage, a new JSON file with a unique ID is created,
which features a select number of ellipses which were used to create the user's
pattern. This file is then processed using PHP and a select number of these ellipses
are then added to the collective patterns found on the BROWSE page, along with the
data from the HTML form.
